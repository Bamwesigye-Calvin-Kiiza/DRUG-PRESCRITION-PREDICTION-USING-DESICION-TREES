# Drug Prescription Prediction using Decision Trees

## Introduction

This repository contains usage of the Decision Tree algorithm for predicting drug prescriptions based on patient data. The exercise guides you through the process of building a machine learning model using historical patient data.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

### Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install 'PACKAGE NAME'
```

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical information about patients and their responses to different medications. It includes features like age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol level.

## Files

- `drug_prescription_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the lab exercise.
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset.
